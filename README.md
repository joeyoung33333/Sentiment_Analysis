# Sentiment_Analysis
This program tries to determine if an article has negative or positive sentiment from online business, technology,and general news sources (see full list above), and uses that information to predict and give insight into a technology company’s stock performance. This project focuses specifically on FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google) stocks because these companies frequently appear in the news. The purpose of the algorithm is to provide users a prediction and insight based off of sentiment from online news articles to gauge the position of a company's stock performance. Although there are many factors that need to be accounted for when trading stocks, much of the necessary information is reported in the news, and sentiment is able to be extracted from the articles to gauge feelings toward a company. Overall, the algorithm will be a tool used to aid in the buying and selling of a company’s shares by giving users informed data since it would be unlikely for them to read hundreds of articles a day on different companies and for them to try and gauge each article’s sentiment.
